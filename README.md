# 1st mini project: Traffic Light
In this tutorial project, I tried to make a traffic light.
Along the way, I learned how to use variables and the "for" loop.
On the Arduino board, I connected the LEDs through 220 ohm resistors.

# Demo
I used a blue LED because I didn't have a yellow one. But in the code everywhere it is indicated as yellow.
